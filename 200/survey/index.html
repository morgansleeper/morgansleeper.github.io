	<h4>My goals for the weekly handouts on your languages were to let you: A) dig into the syntax of a language you’re interested in, B) learn about each topic across a variety of languages, and C) get experience reading/getting information out of reference grammars.

<br>Did this setup work for you? Is there anything that would be helpful to add/change to help support those goals for you?</h4>

	<h4>This semester I tried group-graded homework for the first time!

<br>My goal for the group-grading was for you to get to go over the homeworks after having done them in a way that's more useful than reading over feedback, and to build in time to ask questions & revisit it.

<br>Did you find it helpful? Was there anything you’d change for next time? (Semi-specifically, would it be more helpful to grade in different groups than you started the HW with?)</h4>
