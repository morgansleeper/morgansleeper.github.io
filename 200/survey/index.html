<div class="blurb"><h4>My goals for the weekly handouts on your languages were to let you: <br>A) dig into the syntax of a language you’re interested in, <br>B) learn about each topic across a variety of languages, and <br>C) get experience reading/getting information out of reference grammars.</h4>

<li>Did this setup work for you?</li> <li>Is there anything that would be helpful to add/change to help support those goals for you?</li>

	<h4>This semester I tried group-graded homework for the first time!</h4>

<li>My goal for the group-grading was for you to get to go over the homeworks after having done them in a way that's more useful than reading over feedback, and to build in time to ask questions & revisit it.</li>

<li>Did you find it helpful/did it work for those goals for you?</li><li> Was there anything you’d change for next time? (Semi-specifically, would it be more helpful to grade in different groups than you started the HW with?)</li>
