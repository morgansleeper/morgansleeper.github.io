	<h4>My goals for the weekly handouts on your languages were to let you: A) dig into the syntax of a language you’re interested in, B) learn about each topic across a variety of languages, and C) get experience reading/getting information out of reference grammars.

<br>Did this setup work for you? Is there anything that would be helpful to add/change to help support those goals for you?</h4>

	<h4>The choose-your-own reading and symposium was also a new add this year!

<br>My goals for that were to try and share some broad/‘out of the box’ examples of what Linguistics can be and also let you practice getting information out of articles that might be outside your wheelhouse or be quite dense (or both!).

<br>Did you find it helpful/enjoyable and/or did it work for those goals for you? Is there anything that would be helpful to add/change for that?</h4>
