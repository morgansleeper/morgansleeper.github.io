	This semester I tried group-graded homework for the first time!

<li>My goal for the group-grading was for you to get to go over the homeworks after having done them in a way that's more useful than reading over feedback, and to build in time to ask questions & revisit it.</li>

<li>Did you find it helpful/did it work for those goals for you?</li><li> Was there anything you’d change for next time? (Semi-specifically, would it be more helpful to grade in different groups than you started the HW with?)</li>

<div class="blurb">
The choose-your-own reading and symposium was also a new add this year!

<li>My goals for that were to try and share some broad/‘out of the box’ examples of what Linguistics can be and also let you practice getting information out of articles that might be outside your wheelhouse or be quite dense (or both!).</li>
<li>Did you find it helpful/enjoyable and/or did it work for those goals for you?</li><li>Is there anything that would be helpful to add/change for that?</li>
