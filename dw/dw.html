    <h1>Syntax S21: Word Classes in Dakw채k찾da Warriors</h1>
    <p>This bilingual comic, written by Cole Pauls, uses both English and
      Southern Tutchone throughout the text. See if you can use context to sus
      out what each of the Southern Tutchone words mean, and then, for each
      word, see if you can use <em>morphosyntactic evidence</em> (form, distribution,
      or function!) to figure out what word class they might belong to!</p>
