<h2>Music and language</h2>

<p>As a lifelong musician, the intersection of music and language has been at the heart of my linguistic interests 
  from the start. I’m interested in the potential of music for language revitalization efforts, but also in the 
  integration of musical and linguistic data in linguistic analysis — what can we learn by treating the combination 
  of music and language as a holistic site of inquiry rather than than simply language data with a melody?</p>
<p>To that end, I’m currently focused on describing new methodologies that combine (ethno)musicological and linguistic approaches, 
  and applying them to questions of both structural (i.e. tone systems, phonetic variation, morphology) and sociocultural 
  (i.e. code-switching, identity) linguistics.</p>
<p>A few of the projects I’ve worked on with regards to music and language are:</p>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Tone and tune in Tlahuapa Tu’un Sàví Songs</b> <br>(presentation given at WAIL 20, 2017;

   and the relationship between musical melody and lexical tone in this Mixtec language.

<h2>Patagonian Welsh</h2>

<p>As part of my Watson Fellowship in 2011-2012, I travelled to Chubut, Argentina to learn about music and language 
  revitalization in Welsh-speaking Patagonia (<em>Y Wladfa</em>), and became fascinated by the language and culture of this 
  unique region. Since returning, I have aimed to help document the distinctive features of this understudied variety 
  of Welsh, as well as what its structure and usage can tell us about language contact. Much of my work utilizes the 
  fantastic <a href = http://bangortalk.org.uk/>Bangor Siarad and Bangor Patagonia corpora</a>, and is thus representative 
of naturalistic, conversational speech — including code-switching into Spanish and English.
</p>
<p>Some of the results of this work can be seen here:</p>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Contact effects on voice-onset timing (VOT) in Patagonian Welsh </b>
  <br>
  (<a href = /Sleeper_MA.pdf>my MA thesis</a>, 2015; 
  <a href = /Sleeper_ASA2016_poster.pdf>poster</a> version presented at ASA 2016)

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Phonetic corpus study showing that Patagonian speakers produce /p t k/ with 
    lower average VOT values than speakers from Wales.

  </p>
</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Nasal mutation variation in Wales and Patagonia</b> 
  <br>(<a href = /Sleeper_NWAV45_poster.pdf>poster</a> presented at NWAV 45, 2016)

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Corpus study showing that for both Patagonian and Welsh speakers, 
    the geographical and cultural ‘Welshness’ of placenames affect their mutation behaviour following <em>yn</em> ‘in’, 
    and that soft mutation has become an important component of this prescriptively nasally-mutating environment.

<h2>More</h2>
<p>Besides these main foci, my research interests also include language contact, code-switching, phonetics, and VOT more broadly, as well as phonation,
  Cherokee, Bergamasque, Ainu, anime, and manga in translation.</p>
