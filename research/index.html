<h2>Language and music</h2>
<img src="/pics/eisteddfod.jpg" height= "200" style="float:right; padding: 0px 20px 20px 20px"/>
<p>As a lifelong musician, the intersection of language and music has been at the heart of my linguistic interests
  from the start. I’m interested in the potential of music for language revitalization efforts, and also in the
  integration of musical and linguistic data in linguistic analysis — what can we learn by treating the combination
  of music and language as a holistic site of inquiry rather than than simply language data with a melody?</p>

  <p>To that end, in my work, I focus on describing new methodologies that combine
  ethnomusicological and linguistic approaches, and applying them to questions of structural linguistics,
  sociocultural linguistics, and language revitalization.</p>

  <p>A few projects I work or have worked on with regards to music and language include:</p>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Musicolinguistic Documentation: Tone and Tune in Tlahuapa Tù'un Sàví Songs</b>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Musicolinguistic study of how vaporwave is constructed as a genre through both
    music and (spoken and visual) language, and how specific musical production techniques

<h2>Patagonian Welsh</h2>
<img src="/pics/ysgolyrhendre.jpg" height= "200" style="float:right; padding: 0px 20px 20px 20px"/>
<p>As part of my Watson Fellowship in 2011-2012, I travelled to Chubut, Argentina to learn about music and language
  revitalization in Welsh-speaking Patagonia (<em>Y Wladfa</em>), and became fascinated by the language and culture of this
  unique region. Since then, I have aimed to help document the distinctive features of this understudied variety
  of Welsh, as well as what its structure and usage can tell us about language contact. Much of my work utilizes the
  fantastic <a href = http://bangortalk.org.uk/>Bangor Siarad and Bangor Patagonia corpora</a>, and is thus representative
of naturalistic, conversational speech — including code-switching into Spanish and English.
</p>
<p>Some of the results of this work can be seen here:</p>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Contact effects on voice-onset timing (VOT) in Patagonian Welsh</b> <br>
  <em>Journal of the International Phonetic Assocation</em> 50(2), 2020, p. 153-167. <a href = https://doi.org/10.1017/S002510031800021X>https://doi.org/10.1017/S002510031800021X</a> <br>
  Pre-print PDF available <a href = /docs/Sleeper_VOT_preprint.pdf>here</a>!

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Corpus study using linear mixed-effects modeling, showing that Patagonian speakers produce the voiceless stop series /p t k/ with
    lower average VOT values than speakers from Wales, as a result of contact with Spanish.

  Pre-print PDF available <a href = /docs/Sleeper_PlaceNames_preprint.pdf>here</a>!

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Corpus study using conditional inference trees and random forests, showing that for both Patagonian and Welsh speakers,
    the geographical and cultural ‘Welshness’ of placenames affect their mutation behaviour following <em>yn</em> ‘in’,
    and that soft mutation has become an important component of this prescriptively nasally-mutating environment.

<h2>Language in Japanese popular media</h2>
<img src="/pics/sailormoons.png" height= "200" style="float:right; padding: 0px 20px 20px 20px"/>
<p>A third pillar of my research program involves exploring the role of language in Japanese popular media (such as
  anime and manga), both in the original Japanese and in translation. Like my work on music and language, this research
  stems from an interest in interdisciplinarity and multimodality, and uses methods from linguistics alongside
  relevant methodological lenses from other disciplines, such as comic, media, and feminist studies.
</p>
<p>A few of the projects I've worked on in this area include:</p>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>‘Japaneseness’ & Reader Identity in Two Translations of 'Sailor Moon'</b>
  <br>
  <em>Journal of Anime and Manga Studies</em> 2, 2021, p. 121-154. <a href = https://doi.org/10.21900/j.jams.v2.825>https://doi.org/10.21900/j.jams.v2.825</a> <br>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	With Daphne Iskos, a study using methods from sociocultural linguistics and comic studies to show how
    differences in the use of loanwords, honorifics, onomatopoeia, and iconicity in each of two translations
    serve to either erase (in the case of the earlier release) or actively construct (in the case of the later)
    the sociocultural construct of 'Japaneseness' within the text.
  </p>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Hot and heavy: The phonetic performance of fatness and <em>fujoshi</em> in 'Kiss Him, Not Me'</b>
  <br>
  (earlier <a href = /docs/Sleeper_NWAV46_poster.pdf>poster</a> version presented at NWAV 46, 2017)

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Sociophonetic study which shows how bundles of phonetic features are used in anime to
    create equivalence between a physical characteristic – in this case, the main character's fatness – and a sociocultural
    category – here, her status as a <em>fujoshi</em> (a female fan of media depicting homoerotic male relationships), contrasting
    both of these against performances of traditionally desirable anime femininity.

<p>Besides these three main foci, my research interests also include language contact, linguistic landscapes, code-switching, and revitalization more broadly,
  as well as Cherokee, Bergamasco, and Ainu.</p>
