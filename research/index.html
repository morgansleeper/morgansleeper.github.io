<h2>Language and music</h2>
<img src="/eisteddfod.jpg" height= "200" style="float:right; padding: 0px 20px 20px 20px"/>
<p>As a lifelong musician, the intersection of language and music has been at the heart of my linguistic interests 
  from the start. I’m interested in the potential of music for language revitalization efforts, and also in the 
  integration of musical and linguistic data in linguistic analysis — what can we learn by treating the combination 
  of music and language as a holistic site of inquiry rather than than simply language data with a melody?</p>

  To that end, in my work, I focus on describing new methodologies that combine 
  ethnomusicological and linguistic approaches, and applying them to questions of structural linguistics, 
  sociocultural linguistics, and language revitalization.</p>

  <p>A few projects I work or have worked on with regards to music and language include:</p>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Tone and Tune in Tlahuapa Tù’un Sàví Songs</b>
  <br>(article version forthcoming; earlier version available as Chapter 2 of <a href = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/59p4d43d>my dissertation</a>)
 <p style="margin-left: 40px">On integrating musical data into language documentation in ELAN, Praat, etc., 
   and on the relationship between musical melody and linguistic tone in Tlahuapa Tù'un Sàví (Mixtec, Guerrero).

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Multimodal Mist: The Musicolinguistic Landscapes of Vaporwave</b> 
  <br>(presentation given at AAA 2019; 
  <a href = /Sleeper_Vaporwave_Slides.pdf>slides</a>, <a href = /Sleeper_Vaporwave_Script.pdf>script</a>)

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Musicolinguistic study of how vaporwave is constructed as a genre through both
    music and (spoken and visual) language, and how specific musical production techniques
    license imagined musicolinguistic landscapes in the minds of listeners, allowing them to participate in the genre's
    central themes.

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Singing Synthesizers: Language Revitalization through UTAUloid</b>

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	On how linguists can help contribue to musical language revitalization through the creation

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Musicolinguistic analysis of eco grime which shows how the genre reimagines "the club"

<h2>Patagonian Welsh</h2>
<img src="/ysgolyrhendre.jpg" height= "200" style="float:right; padding: 0px 20px 20px 20px"/>
<p>As part of my Watson Fellowship in 2011-2012, I travelled to Chubut, Argentina to learn about music and language 
  revitalization in Welsh-speaking Patagonia (<em>Y Wladfa</em>), and became fascinated by the language and culture of this 
  unique region. Since then, I have aimed to help document the distinctive features of this understudied variety 
  of Welsh, as well as what its structure and usage can tell us about language contact. Much of my work utilizes the 
  fantastic <a href = http://bangortalk.org.uk/>Bangor Siarad and Bangor Patagonia corpora</a>, and is thus representative 
of naturalistic, conversational speech — including code-switching into Spanish and English.
</p>
<p>Some of the results of this work can be seen here:</p>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Contact effects on voice-onset timing (VOT) in Patagonian Welsh</b> <br>

    the geographical and cultural ‘Welshness’ of placenames affect their mutation behaviour following <em>yn</em> ‘in’,

<h2>Language in Japanese popular media</h2>
<img src="/sailormoons.png" height= "200" style="float:right; padding: 0px 20px 20px 20px"/>
<p>A third pillar of my research program involves exploring the role of language in Japanese popular media (such as 
  anime and manga), both in the original Japanese and in translation. Like my work on music and language, this research
  stems from an interest in interdisciplinarity and multimodality, and uses methods from linguistics alongside 
  relevant methodological lenses from other disciplines, such as comic, media, and feminist studies.
</p>
<p>A few of the projects I've worked on in this area include:</p>

<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Hot and heavy: The phonetic performance of fatness and <em>fujoshi</em> in 'Kiss Him, Not Me'</b>
  <br>
  (<a href = /Sleeper_NWAV46_poster.pdf>poster</a> presented at NWAV 46, 2017)

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	Sociophonetic study which shows how bundles of phonetic features are used in anime to 
    create equivalence between a physical characteristic – in this case, the main character's fatness – and a sociocultural 
    category – here, her status as a <em>fujoshi</em> (a female fan of media depicting homoerotic male relationships), contrasting
    both of these against performances of traditionally desirable anime femininity.

</li>
<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Consuming Cool Japan: Constructing foreignness and reader identity in two translations of 'Sailor Moon'</b> 
  <br>(<a href = /Sleeper_SailorMoon_Manuscript.pdf>manuscript</a>; presentation given at AAA 2014: 
  <a href = /Sleeper_AAA_2014_slides.pdf>slides</a>, 
  <a href = /Sleeper_AAA_2014_script.pdf>script</a>)

  <p style="margin-left: 40px">	A study using methods from discourse analysis and comic studies to show how 
    differences in the use of loanwords, honorifics, onomatopoeia, and iconicity in each of two translations 
    serve to either erase (in the case of the earlier release) or actively construct (in the case of the later) 
    the sociocultural construct of 'Japaneseness' within the text.

<p>Besides these three main foci, my research interests also include language contact, linguistic landscapes, code-switching, and revitalization more broadly, 
  as well as Cherokee, Bergamasque, and Ainu.</p>
