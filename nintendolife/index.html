<h1>Nintendo Life</h1>
<p>In addition to research in linguistics, since 2012 I have also written about video games for <a href = http://www.nintendolife.com><b>Nintendo Life</b></a>, 
  the world's largest independent Nintendo website. I specialize in reviews and interviews, but also write features, previews, 
  and guides, and cover industry events.</p>
<p>All of my writing for Nintendo Life can be read
