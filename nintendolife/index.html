<h1>Nintendo Life</h1>
<p>In addition to research in linguistics, since 2012 I have also written about video games for <a href = http://www.nintendolife.com><b>Nintendo Life</b></a>, 
  a UK-based website. I specialize in reviews and interviews, but also write features, guides, and previews, and cover industry events
  like E3. 
  A selection of my recent articles is below, and all my work for Nintendo Life can be read
